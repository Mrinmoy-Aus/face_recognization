# Face Recognition


Recognize and manipulate faces from Python or from the command line with
the world's simplest face recognition library.

Built using [dlib](http://dlib.net/)'s state-of-the-art face recognition
built with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the
[Labeled Faces in the Wild](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) benchmark.

This also provides a simple `face_recognition` command line tool that lets
you do face recognition on a folder of images from the command line!



## Features

#### Find faces in pictures

Find all the faces that appear in a picture:

```python
import face_recognition
image = face_recognition.load_image_file("your_file.jpg")
face_locations = face_recognition.face_locations(image)
```

#### Find and manipulate facial features in pictures

Get the locations and outlines of each person's eyes, nose, mouth and chin.

```python
import face_recognition
image = face_recognition.load_image_file("your_file.jpg")
face_landmarks_list = face_recognition.face_landmarks(image)
```

Finding facial features is super useful for lots of important stuff. But you can also use it for really stupid stuff
like applying [digital make-up](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/blob/master/examples/digital_makeup.py) (think 'Meitu'):

#### Identify faces in pictures

Recognize who appears in each photo.

```python
import face_recognition
known_image = face_recognition.load_image_file("biden.jpg")
unknown_image = face_recognition.load_image_file("unknown.jpg")

biden_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(known_image)[0]
unknown_encoding = face_recognition.face_encodings(unknown_image)[0]

results = face_recognition.compare_faces([biden_encoding], unknown_encoding)
```

You can even use this library with other Python libraries to do real-time face recognition:





## Installation

### Requirements

  * Python 3.3+ or Python 2.7
  * macOS or Linux (Windows not officially supported, but might work)

### Installation Options:

#### Installing on Mac or Linux

First, make sure you have dlib already installed with Python bindings:

  * [How to install dlib from source on macOS or Ubuntu](https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/629d75c1baac34dfa5ca2a1928a7aeaf)

Then, install this module from pypi using `pip3` (or `pip2` for Python 2):

```bash
pip3 install face_recognition
```

Alternatively, you can try this library with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), see [this section](#deployment).

If you are having trouble with installation, you can also try out a
[pre-configured VM](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/try-deep-learning-in-python-now-with-a-fully-pre-configured-vm-1d97d4c3e9b).

#### Installing on an Nvidia Jetson Nano board

 * [Jetson Nano installation instructions](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/build-a-hardware-based-face-recognition-system-for-150-with-the-nvidia-jetson-nano-and-python-a25cb8c891fd)
   * Please follow the instructions in the article carefully. There is current a bug in the CUDA libraries on the Jetson Nano that will cause this library to fail silently if you don't follow the instructions in the article to comment out a line in dlib and recompile it.

#### Installing on Raspberry Pi 2+

  * [Raspberry Pi 2+ installation instructions](https://gist.github.com/ageitgey/1ac8dbe8572f3f533df6269dab35df65)

#### Installing on Windows

While Windows isn't officially supported, helpful users have posted instructions on how to install this library:

  * [@masoudr's Windows 10 installation guide (dlib + face_recognition)](https://github.com/ageitgey/face_recognition/issues/175#issue-257710508)

#### Installing a pre-configured Virtual Machine image

  * [Download the pre-configured VM image](https://medium.com/@ageitgey/try-deep-learning-in-python-now-with-a-fully-pre-configured-vm-1d97d4c3e9b) (for VMware Player or VirtualBox).
